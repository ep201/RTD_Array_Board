# RTD_Array_Board
Contained are the KiCAD PCB schematic, the code that I've been using and writing for this board, as well as the MAX31865 datasheet.
This code is designed for a board with 8 ADCs all connected to the same SPI bus, so reading is sequential.
Comments and further documentation found in main.cpp and MAX31865.cpp
